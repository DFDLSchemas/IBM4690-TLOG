        <p>This GitHub repository hold DFDL schemas that model Transaction Log (Tlog) data emitted by Toshiba Commerce Solutions (formerly IBM) 4690 point-of-sale devices. There are DFDL schemas for the three main variants:</p>

<ul>
<li>ACE - SurePos ACE v7r4 and earlier </li>
<li>SA - Supermarket Application (coming soon)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use these DFDL schemas in conjunction with IBM's DFDL processor and editor, you will need to use the release of IBM DFDL that is included in IBM WebSphere Message Broker 8.0.0.2 or later, or IBM Integration Bus 9.0.0.1 or later.</p>
<p>This is a public repository that allows anybody to view the content. If you would like to contribute to this repository, email the address on the organisation home page.</p>

<h3>About DFDL</h3>

<p><a href="www.ogf.org/dfdl">Data Format Description Language</a> (DFDL, often pronounced daff-o-dil), published as an <a href="www.ogf.org">Open Grid Forum</a> Proposed Recommendation in January 2011, is a modeling language for describing general text and binary data in a standard way. A DFDL model or schema allows any text or binary data to be read (or "parsed") from its native format and to be presented as an instance of an information set. The same DFDL schema also allows data to be taken from an instance of an information set and written out (or "serialized") to its native format.</p>

<p>If you are new to DFDL a good place to start is the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/se-dfdl/index.html?ca=dat-">DFDL page on IBM developerWorks</a>. This contains links to DFDL implementations, tutorials and videos.</p>
