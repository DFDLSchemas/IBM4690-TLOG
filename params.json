A DFDL model or schema allows any text or binary data to be read (or \"parsed\") from its native format and to be presented as an instance of an information set. The same DFDL schema also allows data to be taken from an instance of an information set and written out (or \"serialized\") to its native format.\r\n\r\nIf you are new to DFDL a good place to start is the [Wikipedia page] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFDL). This contains links to DFDL implementations and tutorials.\r\n","name":"IBM4690-TLOG","google":"","tagline":"DFDL schemas for transaction log data emitted by IBM/Toshiba 4690 point-of-sale devices.","note":"Don't delete this file!
